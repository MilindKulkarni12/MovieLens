Project Title: Analyzing Movie Ratings with PySpark

Project Description: In this mini project, you will use PySpark to analyze a movie ratings dataset and gain insights into
the movie preferences of users. The dataset is a subset of the MovieLens 20M dataset, which contains ratings and tags for
approximately 20 million movie ratings from 138,000 users on 27,000 movies. You will use PySpark to preprocess the data,
perform exploratory data analysis, and build a recommendation model based on user preferences.

Project Steps:

* Load the dataset into PySpark and preprocess the data, such as cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data into a
suitable format.
* Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data, such as finding the most popular movies, the highest-rated
movies, and the most active users.
* Build a collaborative filtering recommendation model using PySpark's ALS algorithm to recommend movies based on user preferences.
* Evaluate the performance of the recommendation model using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.
* Deploy the recommendation model to a web application or a mobile app for users to interact with and receive personalized
movie recommendations.

Expected Outcome: At the end of this mini project, you will have gained hands-on experience with PySpark and machine learning
algorithms, and have built a recommendation model that can be used to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.
You will also have learned how to preprocess and analyze large datasets using PySpark.

The dataset is available in various formats, including CSV, JSON, and Parquet. You can choose the format that best suits
your needs. The dataset contains movie ratings and tags for approximately 20 million movie ratings from 138,000 users on 27,000 movies.

Make sure to read the documentation on the website carefully to understand the structure of the dataset and how to work
with it in PySpark. Good luck with your project!
